        <h2><i>ðŸŒºAbout Me</i></h2>
            <p>My name is Mahdia Rasooli. I was born on March 12, 2008. I am an Afghan girl filled with endless dreams and hopes for a better future. I live in a country where women face many challenges and are often denied their basic rights, including education and freedom. But even in the darkest times, I hold on to my dreams with all my heart.</p>
        <h2><i>ðŸŽ“My Educational Journey</i></h2>
            <p>I completed my 11th grade at Hashim Barat High School in Afghanistan during the winter of 2022. Soon after, a heartbreaking announcement spread across the country: girls and women were banned from attending schools, universities, and even working. At first, I tried to stay strong and told myself this situation would pass. But one night, the pain and sadness became too much. I cried silently, asking myself if I was truly human â€” because like everyone, I also have feelings and dreams.
            
            That night, I promised myself that this would not be the end. I wiped away my tears and decided to keep fighting. I told myself that if one door closes, many windows of opportunity will open. I began searching for online learning opportunities. My first online course was an Intermediate English course organized by AYLA. Although I did not even have my own phone and used my sisterâ€™s or fatherâ€™s phone, I managed to join and succeed.
            
            Later, my sister introduced me to an online university that accepts students from all over the world. I applied with doubt because I did not have my graduation documents yet, but I was accepted and started my university studies on November 16, 2023. When they asked for my documents, I worked hard to get my transcripts from my school and explained my situation honestly to the university. Thankfully, they understood and allowed me to continue.
            
            In addition to university, I took part in other online courses, including programming and English. I also became an English instructor with Victory Afghanistan organization. Through this organization, I found another opportunity at Living Wisdom International School. I joined this school and completed my 12th grade on December 6, 2025. I will always remember our graduation night â€” our happy tears, heartfelt speeches, and the sense of victory after so many challenges.</p>
            <h2><i>ðŸ’»My Passion and Changing Dreams</i></h2>
                <p>When I started university, I chose Computer Science as my major because I loved technology and designing websites. I still love it and continue studying it with passion. But over time, my dreams began to change.
                
                Now, I dream of becoming an actress. My goal is to first become financially independent through my Computer Science career and then, one day, study acting. I want to express myself freely and tell stories that inspire people.
                
                I know this dream is difficult for my family and my society to accept because of traditional views and stereotypes about actresses. But I believe that someday, people in my country will change their perspectives and respect every dream. Even though I donâ€™t think I have a special talent yet, I want to work hard and achieve it at any cost. I still love Computer Science, and I believe it will help me stand on my own feet and support my future goals.</p>
                <h2><i>âœ¨My Hopes for the Future</i></h2>
                    <p>I want to be free â€” emotionally, mentally, and financially. I dream of inspiring other Afghan girls to follow their dreams, no matter how impossible they may seem. I believe that one day, all Afghan women will regain their freedom and shine brightly in the world. As Mawlana says <q>Where there is ruin, there is hope for a treasure.</q><a href="https://www.poemhunter.com/mewlana-jalaluddin-rumi/">Mawlana's quote</a></p>
