        <hr>
        <h2><i>ðŸŒºAbout Me</i></h2>
            <p>My name is Mahdia Rasooli. I was born on March 12, 2008. I am an Afghan girl filled with endless dreams and hopes for a better future.
                I am currently a CS student and completed high school at Living Wisdom International School. I am a web designer, tailor, English instructor, teaching online, a Digital Content Creator and Global Conversation Partner at Aquaint. I am passionate about learning, growing, and inspiring others through my work and creativity</p>
        <h2><i>ðŸŽ“My Educational Journey</i></h2>
            <p>I completed 11th grade at Hashim Barat High School in Afghanistan in 2022. Even during the difficult times when the government does not allow women to continue their education, I stay strong and focused on my goals. I started my online learning journey first by joining at different online English courses. Later, I bravely applied to an accredited, online, and American university and was accepted in November 2023, showing my dedication and determination.

                Alongside university, I took part in other online courses, including programming and English, and worked as an English instructor with Victory Afghanistan organization. Through this, I found another opportunity at Living Wisdom International School, where I successfully completed my 12th grade(last year of high school) in June 12, 2025. My graduation was a moment of great joy and pride, celebrating all my hard work and achievements.</p>
            <h2><i>ðŸ’»My Passion and Changing Dreams</i></h2>
                <p>When I started university, I chose Computer Science as my major because I loved technology and designing websites. I still enjoy it and continue studying with great interest. However, deep in my heart, I also hold a personal dream related to acting. A dream that is not easy for my traditional family and society to accept. Even though I face strict cultural expectations, I stay strong and believe in following my passions while working hard to become independent and confident.</p>
                <h2><i>âœ¨My Hopes for the Future</i></h2>
                    <p>I want to be free emotionally, mentally, financially, and in every aspect of my life have freedom. I dream of inspiring other Afghan girls to follow their dreams, no matter how impossible they may seem. I deeply believe that one day, all Afghan women will regain their freedom and shine brightly in the world.
